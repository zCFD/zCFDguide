Mesh Conversion Utilities
=========================

The unstructured mesh for zCFD is encapslated using the `hdf5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_ specification, that provides a flexible, self describing format
that also supports parallel I/O that can be tuned per filesystem type (e.g NFS, GPFS, Lustre etc).

We provide a range of converters for popular mesh types.
