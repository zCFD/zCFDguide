Verification and Validation
===========================

Introduction
------------

This Verification guide contains selected cases to which the zCFD many-core accelerated 
Computational Fluid Dynamics solver has been applied. For each of these cases a comparison
has been made to various compiled validation results, thus enabling the user to easily 
discern the accuracy achieved by the solver.
